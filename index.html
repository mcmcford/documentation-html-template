                                <h4 id="line2_1">General Commands - </h4>
                                <p><b>!quote</b> - This is obviously one of the more important commands that exists, this is used for quoting someone within the server, it is fairly simple to use as can be seen in these examples: <br><br><b>!quote @josh "I like this bot"</b><br><b>!quote @martin *clash of clans music*</b></p>
                                <p>Simple right?<br>Well, if you want to take this a step further, the bot will also accept the users DiscordID opposed to a ping, meaning you can quote them without needing to ping them as can be seen below:<br><br><b>!quote 462300281817006111 "I like this bot"</b><br><b>!quote 144194743432118277 *clash of clans music*</b></p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b>!quote2</b> - This command is similar to the previous command however it allows you to quote an interaction between two people in the server. Think of it like a question response format (I am currently working on expanding this to allow for more than 2 inputs / quotes). You can see how it would be used in the examples below:<br><br><b>!quote2 @max "Jacob someone made a website..." @jacob "NO!"</b><br><b>!quote2 @tom "smh" @josh "SHUT THE F*** UP TOM"</b></p>
                                <p>What if you want to quote two people saying the same thing?<br>Well, there is an easy way to do that too!<br><br><b>!quote2 @tom @harry "Jinx!"<b></p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b>!outsidequote</b> - (!oquote for short) What to quote something you overheared in your day to day life, or a family member who doesn't have discord but you really need your friends to know what they said? then you can use the !oquote command (short for !outsidequote). This allows you to quote non-discord users as you can see in the examples below:<br><br><b>!oquote [My Mum] "I'm a cat girl"</b><br><b>!oquote [Average overwatch player] "When in doubt bastion out!" </b></p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b><a id="custom_quote"></a>!customquote</b> - (!cquote for short) This is a much more flexible command which can do everything !quote, !quote2 and !oquote can do alongside a bunch more (like adding images to quotes!). So! If you want to quote more than two people, want to add context to a quote with an image or want to be able to quote more than one 'outside' user / non-discord user then this command will allow you do it all. It is a little more complicated to use however so all the details have been carefully layed out below:</p>
                                <p><b>!customquote take a series of arguments as listed below:</b><br>-[u]    (for user) This accepts any @mention of a user or any valid userID<br>-[o]    (for outside user) This accepts a string value so 'John Doe', 'Alice', 'Henry Tudor, son of Henry VII and Elizabeth York' are all valid names<br>-[q]    (for quote) This, once again, is just a string value so: "Funny thing" would be valid<br>-[i]    (for image) This accepts a URL of an image eg "<a href="https://placekitten.com/g/200/300">https://placekitten.com/g/200/300</a>"</p>
                                <p><br>So, to bring that all together, the commands for !customquote would look something like this:<br><b>!customquote -[u] @morgan -[q] "Funny thing morgan said" -[u] @Harry -[o] Harrys friend who isn't on discord -[q] *funny thing harry and his friend said simultaneously* -[i] <a href="https://placekitten.com/g/200/300">https://relaventimagetothestory.com/image.jpeg</a></b></p>
                                <p>It is quite long-winded however currently it seems like the best way to tackle 'custom quotes' and shouldn't be too hard to pick up. There are various combinations of arguments you can you, you just need to make sure that you stick to the guidelines below:<br>Don't quote more than 25 people<br>Only use 1 image<br>Keep all quotes below 256 characters long</p>
                                
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b>!edit</b> - [This currently only works with !quote created quotes, not !quote2 or !oquote (they are still in development)] Everyone is prone to making a typo every now and again so the !edit command allows you to fix any errors you make. Using this command you can edit either the quote it's self, or the person you were quoting by following this format: <br><br><b>!edit {quoteID} quote "Hey, this is the version without the typo!"</b> <br>or<br> <b>!edit {quoteID} person @ThePersonWhoActuallySaidTheFunnyThing</b><br><br>For this, i should clarify, the 'quoteID' is the discord Message's ID, if you don't know how to find that, you can read the steps in <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-">this offical discord post</a>.  It is also important to remember, every discord message has a different ID so it is important to use the original ID of the quote (the first time the quote was posted, usually in the servers dedicated quote channel) as the IDs of any other copies of the quote, such as those that may come up when using the !randomquote, !quotesearch or !getquote command won't work.<br>You can see full examples of how the quote should work below:</p>
                                <p><b>!edit 918894597797724270 quote "Hahaha"</b><br><b>!edit 918893635662147594 person @max</b></p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b>!random</b> - This command is very simple, it just finds and posts a random quote from the server (if you are going through a lot of random ones, you can shorten the command to !r although this command does have a short cooldown)</p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p><b>!quotesearch</b> - This command is used for searching for quotes that contain certain words or phrases, you can see how they would be used below:</p>
                                <p><b>!quotesearch "Jinx"</b><br><b>!quotesearch f***</b></p>
                                <p>Both of these will return any quotes that contain those words / phrases.</p>
                                <br><br>
